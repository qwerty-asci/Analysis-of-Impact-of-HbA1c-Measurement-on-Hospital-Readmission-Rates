# Analysis-of-Impact-of-HbA1c-Measurement-on-Hospital-Readmission-Rates
In this repository, an analysis is performed on the dataset presented in “Impact of HbA1c Measurement on Hospital Readmission Rates: Analysis of 70,000 Clinical Database Patient Records,” BioMed Research International, vol. 2014, Article ID 781670, 11 pages, 2014, in order to study the influence of HbA1c levels on hospital readmission rates.


During the digestion, the body break down carbohydrates into molecules of different types of sugar. One of these
is the glucose, which is one of the main sources of energy for our body. After the breakdown, glucose enters the
bloodstream, where it is distributed through body. However, glucose cannot enter most tissue on its own; it needs
the help of a hormone called insulin, which is produced in the pancreas. Therefore, the presence of this hormone
is fundamental for overall well-being.


However, if a person has diabetes, the production of insulin on the body decrease, or the person becomes resistant
to this hormone. This leads to an increase in glucose levels in the bloodstream, a condition known as hyperglycemia.
Poorly management or recognition of hyperglycemia can significantly increase the risk of both mortality and mor-
bidity. Therefore, many tools are employed to monitor and control glucose levels in patients in the intensive care
unit (ICU). However, in the case of inpatients outside of ICU, glucose control tends to be more arbitrary and may
result in either a lack of treatment or large fluctuations in glucose levels [2],[1],[3]. This poor glycemic control can
increase the likelihood of future patient readmission.


Consequently, in [3] the measurement of the HbA1c is analyzed its influence on readmission rate. The authors
propose to use this marker to determine the presence of diabetes, with the aim of predicting the likelihood of future
patient readmission.
